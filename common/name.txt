What is a good name for the time of the build process and later for new users?

To wait with a name until it's clearly visible how the development goes can have advantages.

- people tend to habituate and they might complain when things like the name changes later
- you have more time in case legal trouble arises.
- you can give the final choice of the name in the hands of your community


To create a final name can have advantages aswell.

- it will make it easier for people to identify with the project
- you dont have to carefully replace references to your previous name
- the development might drift off less easily
